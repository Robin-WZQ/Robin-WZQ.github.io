[Personalized Denoising Implicit Feedback for Robust Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00348)
**Kaike Zhang**, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Fei Sun, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng

- We identify the limitations of existing loss-based denoising methods, highlighting the significant overlap between normal and noisy  interactions in the overall loss distribution.
- We find that, for a given user, there is a clear distinction between normal and noisy interactions in the user's personal loss distribution. Leveraging this insight, we propose a resampling strategy for denoising, PLD.
- We conduct an in-depth theoretical analysis, proving PLD's effectiveness and suggesting ways to further enhance its performance.

[“I Know You Are Discriminatory!”: Automated Substantiating for Individual Fairness Auditing of AI Systems](#)
Yuanhao Liu, Qi Cao, Huawei Shen, **Kaike Zhang**, Yunfan Wu

- We propose substantiating as a framework for individual fairness auditing of AI systems, which is a solution for situations where auditors lack access to model information and data.
- To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose the utilization of automated data generation methods for individual fairness audits, and we designed two categories of methods.
- We conduct experiments on four public datasets to evaluate our methods. Additionally, the experiment on GPT-4 shows the effectiveness of our substantiating framework for individual fairness auditing.

[Understanding and Improving Adversarial Collaborative Filtering for Robust Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22844)
**Kaike Zhang**, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Fei Sun, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng

- We provide theoretical evidence that ACF can achieve better performance and robustness compared to traditional CF in both clean and poisoned data contexts.
- We further identify upper and lower bounds of reduction in recommendation error for ACF during optimization and demonstrate that applying personalized perturbation magnitudes for each user can further improve ACF.
- Based on the above theoretical understandings, we propose Personalized Magnitude Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (PamaCF), with extensive experiments confirming that PamaCF further improves both performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art defense methods.

- We delve into utilizing PLM insights to identify the mismatched relationship and shared characteristics of poisoned samples, forming a two-stage detection strategy.
- Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our approach’s effectiveness across various datasets and attack strategies, achieving better performance more swiftly.

[Improving the Shortest Plank: Vulnerability-Aware Adversarial Training for Robust Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17476)
**Kaike Zhang**, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Fei Sun, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng

- Through extensive empirical analysis, we interestingly find that “users with a higher degree of fit within the recommender system are at a higher risk of being affected by attacks”.
- Building on these insights, we introduce a novel vulnerability-aware adversarial training method, VAT, applying user-adaptive magnitudes of perturbations based on users’ vulnerabilities.
- Our comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of VAT in resisting various attacks, maintaining recommendation quality, and demonstrating its adaptability across various recommendation models.

[Accelerating the Surrogate Retraining for Poisoning Attacks against Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10666)
Yunfan Wu, Qi Cao, Shuchang Tao, **Kaike Zhang**, Fei Sun, Huawei Shen
- We introduce a novel method Gradient Passing (GP) based on
both intuitive and theoretical analyses, accelerating the retraining
process of surrogate recommenders.
- We present the use of GP to enhance data poisoning attacks. It can
be integrated into state-of-the-art attack methods and combined
with other techniques.
- Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and six victim
recommenders validate the efficiency and effectiveness of GP.

[LoRec: Combating Poisons with Large Language Model for Robust Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17723.pdf)
