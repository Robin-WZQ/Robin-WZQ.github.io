Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I’m **Zhongqi Wang (王中琦)**, a Third-year PhD candidate with the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Now I am under the supervision of Prof. [Shiguang Shan](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/~sgshan) and work closely with Prof. [Jie Zhang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/jzhang/) and Prof. [Xilin Chen](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/xlchen/). My research interests cover computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, particularly include backdoor attacks and defenses, model evaluation, AI safety and trustworthiness.

[Dynamic Attention Analysis for Backdoor Detection in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11300728)
 
  **Zhongqi Wang**, Jie Zhang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen.
- We propose a novel backdoor detection method based on Dynamic Attention Analysis (DAA), which sheds light on dynamic anomalies of cross-attention maps in backdoor samples.
- We introduce two progressive methods, *i.e.*, DAA-I and DAA-S, to extract features and quantify dynamic anomalies. 
- Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods under six representative backdoor attack scenarios, achieving the average score of 86.27% AUC.

[Dysca: A Dynamic and Scalable Benchmark for Evaluating Perception Ability of LVLMs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bU1JOvdXXK)
 
 Jie Zhang, **Zhongqi Wang**, Mengqi Lei, Zheng Yuan, Bei Yan, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen. (Student first author)
- A benchmark that is able to dynamically generate the test data that users need and is easily to scale up to to new subtasks and scenarios.
- Dysca aims to testing LVLMs’ performance on diverse styles, 4 image scenarios and 3 question types, reporting the 20 perceptual subtasks performance of 26 mainstream LVLMs,
including GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro.
- We demonstrate for the first time that evaluating LVLMs using large-scale synthetic data is valid.

[T2IShield: Defending against backdoors on text-to-image diffusion models](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-73013-9_7)
 
 **Zhongqi Wang**, Jie Zhang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen.
- The first backdoor defense method for Text-to-image diffusion models.
- We show the "Assimilation Phenomenon" in the backdoor samples.
- By analyzing the structural correlation of attention maps, we propose two detection techniques: Frobenius Norm Threshold Truncation and Covariance Discriminant Analysis.
- Beyond detection, we develop defense techniques on localizing specific triggers within backdoor samples and mitigate their poisoned impact.
